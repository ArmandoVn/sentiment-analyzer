<h2>About this project</h2>
<br>
<p>The project was built on python language and uses the Naive Bayes classifier that is based on the Bayes Theorem.</p>
<br>
<h3>How does the program work?</h3>
<br>
<p>The program was made with python language and uses the NLTK library to make the text analysis</p>
<p>The analyzer was trained and tested with many reviews, to have an accuracy_score of:</p>
<p><b>{{accuracy_score}}</b></p>
<br>
<p>This accuracy score was possible by training the model with 10,000 different reviews.</p>
